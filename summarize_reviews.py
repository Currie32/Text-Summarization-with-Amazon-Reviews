# # Summarizing Text with Amazon Reviews

# The objective of this project is to build a model that can create relevant summaries for reviews written about fine foods sold on Amazon. This dataset contains above 500,000 reviews, and is hosted on [Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)
# 
# To build our model we will use a two-layered bidirectional RNN with LSTMs on the input data and two layers, each with an LSTM using bahdanau attention on the target data. [Jaemin Cho's tutorial](https://github.com/j-min/tf_tutorial_plus/tree/master/RNN_seq2seq/contrib_seq2seq) for seq2seq was really helpful to get the code in working order because this is my first project with TensorFlow 1.1; some of the functions are very different from 1.0. The architecture for this model is similar to Xin Pan's and Peter Liu's, here's their [GitHub page.](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/textsum)
# 
# The sections of this project are:
# - Inspecting the Data
# - Preparing the Data
# - Building the Model
# - Training the Model
# - Making Our Own Summaries

# ## Training the Model

# Since I am training this model on my MacBook Pro, it would take me days if I used the whole dataset. For this reason, I am only going to use a subset of the data, so that I can train it over night. Normally I use [FloydHub's](https://www.floydhub.com/) services for my GPU needs, but it would take quite a bit of time to upload the dataset and ConceptNet Numberbatch, so I'm not going to bother with that for this project.

# - Summary(3): love it

# ## Summary

# I hope that you found this project to be rather interesting and informative. One of my main recommendations for working with this dataset and model is either use a GPU, a subset of the dataset, or plenty of time to train your model. As you might be able to expect, the model will not be able to make good predictions just by seeing many reviews, it needs so see the reviews many times to be able to understand the relationship between words and between descriptions & summaries. 
# 
# In short, I'm pleased with how well this model performs. After creating numerous reviews and checking those from the dataset, I can happily say that most of the generated summaries are appropriate, some of them are great, and some of them make mistakes. I'll try to improve this model and if it gets better, I'll update my GitHub.
# 
# Thanks for reading!
